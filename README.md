# COVID-19-Project
This project is applied Data Analysis on COVID-19 data using SQL and Tableau. 
This data is originally from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, but was edited for a shorter time frame. 

This was a guided project from AlexTheAnalyst (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM). His version of the datasets were used (https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx and https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx).

Various factors were analyzed, including global number of cases, global deaths, and percentage of population infected per country.
As well, Tableau's predictive analysis feature was used to estimate future numbers (at the time of Data gathering) of percentage of population infected.
